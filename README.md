# DiagonalLine
A (really) simple Swift 3 UIView class with a diagonal line rendered and customizable in the storyboard (color, line width, direction)

DiagonalLine: UIView is a @IBDesignable class so that it's rendered in your storyboard, and all its properties are @IBInspectable so that you can customize your diagonal view inside the storyboard in the Attributes inspector.

# Quick install:
* Just drag this class into your project
* In your storyboard, select a UIView
* Go the the identity inspector and in the class field, type DiagonalView instead of UIView
* Play with the attributes inspector with real-times results!
  * pick a color for your line
  * choose the direction (flip)
  * specify the line width
