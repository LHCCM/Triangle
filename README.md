# Triangle and DiagonalLine
Two (really) simple Swift 3 UIView classes with a triangle and a diagonal line rendered and customizable in the storyboard (color, line width, direction)

Triangle: UIView and DiagonalLine: UIView are @IBDesignable classes so that they are rendered in your storyboard, and all their properties are @IBInspectable so that you can customize your triangle and diagonal view inside the storyboard in the Attributes inspector.

# Quick install:
* Just drag these classes into your project
* In your storyboard, select a UIView
* Go the the identity inspector and in the class field, type Triangle or DiagonalView instead of UIView

* Play with the attributes inspector with real-times results!
  * Triangle: pick a fill color
  * Diagonal: pick a color for your line
  * Triangle: choose the three points x and y positions (0 to 1) to create any triangle you want!
  * Diagonal: choose the direction (flip)
  * Diagonal: specify the line width
